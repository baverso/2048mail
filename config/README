# Configuration Files

This directory contains configuration files for the application.

## API Keys

The application requires API keys to function. To set up:

1. Copy `api_keys.template.json` to `api_keys.json`
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys

## File Structure

- `api_keys.json`: Contains actual API keys and credentials (not tracked in git)
- `api_keys.template.json`: Template showing the required API key structure
- `token.pickle`: Stores Google OAuth tokens (auto-generated during authentication)

### api_keys.json

This file contains sensitive credentials and should never be committed to version control. The required structure includes:

- OpenAI API key
- Google OAuth client credentials
  - Client ID
  - Project ID 
  - Auth URIs
  - Client secret

### api_keys.template.json

A template file showing the expected JSON structure for `api_keys.json`. Use this as a reference when setting up your configuration.

### token.pickle

This file is automatically generated during Google OAuth authentication. It stores access and refresh tokens for Google API access. If deleted, you'll need to re-authenticate.

## Security Notes

- Never commit `api_keys.json` or `token.pickle` to version control
- Keep your API keys and credentials secure
- If credentials are compromised, rotate them immediately
