Below is an index of all the agents we’ve defined, along with their inputs and outputs, followed by an analysis on potential optimizations for LangChain implementation.

1.	EMAIL_SUMMARIZER
	•	Inputs:
	•	{{email_content}}: A raw text string containing the complete email content.
	•	{{email_chain}}: The related email chain (conversation thread) in raw text.
	•	Output:
	•	A JSON object with the following keys:
	•	"sender": Sender’s name (and optionally organization).
	•	"subject": Email subject line.
	•	"date": Date when the email was sent.
	•	"key_points": An array summarizing the main points of the email.
	•	"requests_action_items": An array listing any explicit requests or action items.
	•	"context" (optional): Brief context if the email is part of a thread.
	•	"sentiment": A brief sentiment analysis (e.g., “Positive”, “Neutral”).
2.	EMAIL_NEEDS_RESPONSE
	•	Inputs:
	•	A structured email summary (including fields like sender, key points, requests, context, and sentiment) as generated by the EMAIL_SUMMARIZER.
	•	Output:
	•	A plain text decision: either "respond" if a response is needed, or "no response needed" if no action is required.
3.	EMAIL_CATEGORIZER
	•	Inputs:
	•	{{email_content}}: The raw text content of the email to be categorized.
	•	Output:
	•	A JSON object with a single key "decision" whose value is either:
	•	"move forward" – indicating the email should be pursued.
	•	"decline" – indicating it should be declined.
4.	DECLINE_WRITER
	•	Inputs:
	•	{{email_content}}: The raw text content of the email that requires a decline response.
	•	Output:
	•	A freeform email body (plain text) that:
	•	Expresses appreciation.
	•	Politely and clearly declines the request.
	•	Optionally leaves the door open for future opportunities.
	•	Ends with a specific signature block that includes “Thank you,” followed by “Andrew,” a signature, 10 blank lines, and a detailed disclaimer.
5.	SCHEDULE_EMAIL_WRITER
	•	Inputs:
	•	{{email_content}}: The raw text content of the email with a meeting request.
	•	Output:
	•	A freeform email body (plain text) that:
	•	Responds based on one of four predefined scenarios (e.g., sender proposes a time but I’m unavailable, no time zone provided, no specific time suggested, or broad availability).
	•	Includes the exact scheduling link as instructed.
	•	Ends with the same signature block as above.
6.	EMAIL_EDITOR_AGENT
	•	Inputs:
	•	{{draft_email}}: The AI-generated draft email (raw text).
	•	{{edited_email}}: The user-modified (edited) version of the draft (raw text).
	•	Output:
	•	A plain text explanation that details the differences between the two versions, covering tone adjustments, structural modifications, content additions/removals, clarifications, and word choice refinements.
	•	If no meaningful changes exist, the output should state: "No significant changes were made."
7.	EMAIL_WRITER
	•	Inputs:
	•	{{email_content}}: The raw text content of the incoming email.
	•	Output:
	•	A freeform email response (plain text) that fully addresses the sender’s request. The response is tailored based on the email’s intent and category and may include a meeting scheduling link if applicable.
	•	The email response must follow a professional format and end with the standard signature block (identical to the ones used in DECLINE_WRITER and SCHEDULE_EMAIL_WRITER).


Analysis & Optimization Suggestions:
	•	Structured Output Consistency:
For agents that produce freeform text (DECLINE_WRITER, SCHEDULE_EMAIL_WRITER, EMAIL_WRITER), the outputs currently rely on strict formatting rules defined within the prompt. To enhance reliability and integration with LangChain, consider incorporating a StructuredOutputParser or a templating approach (e.g., using Pydantic models) to verify that the output adheres exactly to the required format. This can help prevent variations that might break the workflow.
	•	Uniformity Across Agents:
While some agents (like EMAIL_SUMMARIZER and EMAIL_CATEGORIZER) already output JSON objects, the email drafting agents output plain text. If feasible, wrapping these freeform responses in a JSON structure (even if it only has one key, e.g., "email_body") might provide uniformity, easing downstream processing.
	•	Input Preprocessing:
Ensure that the raw text inputs ({{email_content}}, {{draft_email}}, {{edited_email}}, and {{email_chain}}) are preprocessed consistently before being passed into the respective agents. This can include cleaning up the text, normalizing line breaks, or parsing out headers if necessary.
	•	Memory & Context Integration:
Although memory modules are part of the overall pipeline, consider whether each agent might benefit from explicit references to stored historical context or past responses beyond just the email history. For example, EMAIL_WRITER might include additional prompts to retrieve relevant context from similar past emails if available.
	•	Error Handling & Fallbacks:
It might be beneficial to integrate error handling or fallback responses directly within each prompt. This ensures that if the AI is uncertain or the output deviates from the expected format, the system can flag it for review rather than passing an incomplete or incorrect response to the CEO.
